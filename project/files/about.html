                <h3>Why Is Lorem Ipsum Text Used?</h3>
                <p>You might wonder why a designer would choose to use lorem ipsum text 
                    instead of a few paragraphs in English or their native language. 
                    Why not just copy and paste a page from an old book or lyrics from a famous song?
                    The main reason for using lorem ipsum text is that it keeps people from focusing on the actual text. 
                    When someone creates a template and asks for feedback on it, 
                    they don't want the people reviewing it to get distracted by what the text says. 
                    Instead of focusing on the layout of the text, 
                    people might read the words to, for example, 
                    look for typos.
                    </p>
