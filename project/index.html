            <h1>WELCOME TO M&A CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION</h1>
            <p>However, the common lorem ipsum text we use today is not proper Latin. 
                Compared to Cicero's work, our lorem ipsum text is meaningless. 
                It's had words added, removed, and changed that result in something far from its initial form.
                Dr. Richard McClintock discovered the source of the text when searching for the rare Latin word "consectetur" in classical literature. 
                His search turned up Cicero's work.         
                However, it's unknown who made these modifications to the text, or exactly when, to turn it into 
                the mess of words we know today. Sometime in the 1500s, an unknown printer scrambled words that have survived into the digital age.              
                As far as its modern usage, the earliest known use of lorem ipsum text as a placeholder was in the 1960s, 
                when a company called Letraset used this text on its typeface sheets. Later, in the 1980s, 
                the now-defunct company Adlus also used lorem ipsum placeholder text in its PageMaker desktop publishing software.</p>

            <h3>Why Is Lorem Ipsum Text Used?</h3>
            <p>You might wonder why a designer would choose to use lorem ipsum text 
                instead of a few paragraphs in English or their native language. 
                Why not just copy and paste a page from an old book or lyrics from a famous song?
                The main reason for using lorem ipsum text is that it keeps people from focusing on the actual text. 
                When someone creates a template and asks for feedback on it, 
                they don't want the people reviewing it to get distracted by what the text says. 
                Instead of focusing on the layout of the text, 
                people might read the words to, for example, 
                look for typos.
